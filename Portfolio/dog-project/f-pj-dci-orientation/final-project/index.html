            The education of the puppy begins from the first weeks by the
            mother. The puppy needs to be educated and socialized in order to
            become a balanced and problem-free adult dog. Some parts of the
            education will include, for example, learning to stay home alone or
            not to pee in the house, but also playing appropriately with one's
            fellow humans.

            Training can usually be started in the first few months with simple
            and useful things, such as recall. You can then gradually move on to
            more advanced things but always respecting our friend's times.
            Training in daily life is useful in many situations where we must
            necessarily have control of our dog.

          <p>
            When a puppy becomes part of a family, the people who welcome him
            don't always understand him. Educating a 3-month-old dog is not easy
            because humans expect certain behaviors from him, such as going
            outside, always being calm, responding to calls or not pulling on
            the leash, which he is unable to implement. Each of these
            activities, to be learned, needs specific times and ways which, if
            followed, allow an owner not to rush after his dog. For this reason
            it is advisable to opt for 'prevention' rather than 'cure' by
            requesting the help of a dog educator for a basic educational path
            that can be both individual and group.

          <p>
            In the training course we teach the dog the basic commands through
            targeted exercises that you can easily repeat at home. We focus
            first of all on essential commands such as recall, in training it is
            essential to achieve and maintain a strong relationship of mutual
            trust and listening between man and dog. Dog training exercises are
            real games because through positive reinforcement and play, dogs
            learn everything better and faster! Suitable for all types of dog,
            this course will help your friend channel his energy or bring it out
            through motivation.

          <p>
            The social walk is a group activity that is usually carried out in
            various settings. It is not limited to just running the dog, but
            extends to all aspects related to social interactions. Consequently
            we are going to touch the mental structure of the dog, but also of
            the handler. They take place with the dog on a leash and we start
            after a careful evaluation of the dogs present. By consistently
            selecting the position of each of them, they have the opportunity to
            get to know each other slowly along the way. There are some dogs
            that show difficulty being in groups. In these cases we try to
            facilitate them with distances, which clearly falls within the
            sphere of communication between dogs
